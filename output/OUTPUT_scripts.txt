his other hand comes from under the table and sticks the barrel of his .45 hand under pumpkin ("'s", 'POS') chin .

that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') my bad motherfucker .
there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a passage i got memorized .
for he is truly his brother ("'s", 'POS') keeper and the finder of lost children .
and mr. .45 here , he ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness .
or is could by you 're the righteous man and i 'm the shepherd and it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') the world that 's evil and selfish .

the old man is dressed in a striped t-shirt with a bellhop ("'s", 'POS') cap on .

in game-show host voice " hello -- welcome to this week ("'s", 'POS') edition of the hypocrite of the year award -- "

she cuts kiva ("'s", 'POS') ramble off .
kiva , behind elspeth ("'s", 'POS') back , exits from the bedroom doorway into the hall and comes back in , lugging the tv into the honeymoon bedroom .
and saying this , she kisses kiva ("'s", 'POS') nose and leaves the room .
wearily oh yeah -- it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') so great -- it 's fantastic .

ted holds eva ("'s", 'POS') hippy sacks as she holds her black pot .
eva ("'s", 'POS') heart sinks .

back home , they jist yank on the umbilical cord , do a karate chop on the mama ("'s", 'POS') belly , and them things come right out .
kiva takes elspeth ("'s", 'POS') hand and presses it lightly on her face .
elspeth lets go of kiva ("'s", 'POS') hair .
we are communing here on new year ("'s", 'POS') eve to bring to life the great goddess diana , who was turned to stone in this very room forty years ago today .

that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') cute .
in fact , the whole getup ("'s", 'POS') kind of cute .
the monkey suit ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a nice touch , honey puss .
continuing and i could n't think of a better time for you to introduce me to your beau than on new year ("'s", 'POS') eve .
oh fuck , there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a mistake .
sigfried ("'s", 'POS') mood swings drastically ; he bends down next to ted .
ted ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') better .
oh , for christ ("'s", 'POS') sake , theodore , this is about as intimate a situation as you can get , you , me , and angela here .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') pretty cozy .
sigfried ("'s", 'POS') eyes pop open .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') one way with you , angela , is n't it ?
that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') one thing you can say about angela .
you do n't think i notice there is a gag in the woman ("'s", 'POS') mouth .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') all in the eyes ... points the gun at ted him ?
ted finally gets the point and cautiously removes the gag from angela ("'s", 'POS') mouth .
everyone starts out strangers , ted , it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') where we end up that counts .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') too hard .
there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a gun in my suitcase behind the bed , it 's loaded ...
that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') not fair .
first off , who says he ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') my husband ?
so why ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') he got you tied up ?
that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') it , teddy .
that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') fine .
i used to have a little bunny rabbit named teddy , it looked real cute nibbling on angela ("'s", 'POS') ear .
the directness of sigfried ("'s", 'POS') command , coupled with the sound of a trigger being cocked , forces ted to approach angela .
as he closes in , angela ("'s", 'POS') eyes close .
what ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') the matter , no whiz left in the cheese ?
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') almost all over , theodore , and soon you can go home to mommy .
ted struggles to free himself from sigfried ("'s", 'POS') powerful bear hug and blasts out the following monologue .
do you have any idea what it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') like to go to school where all the other kids ' parents are in jail doing time for crimes like grand larceny , aggravated assault , burglary and murder , and you get stuck with a mother who names you theodore and dressed you up in little matching pink outfits with , get this , a little blue bow fucking tie !
ted cautiously takes sigfried ("'s", 'POS') hand .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a deal , kid .
car horns and a muffled countdown signal that it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') new year 's .
continuing that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') the wrong door , sir .
shouting in the distance it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') no time to take a leak , teddy , i 'm fucking dying here !
he ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') almost safe .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a strange feeling , kind of like bathing in warm water in paradise , knowing a huge shark is ready to rip his ass off .
something ("'s", 'POS') wrong with the guy , all the blood is drained from his face and he is mumbling something .
no one ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') there .
he heads toward the door and , from out of the corner of his eye , he spots sigfried ("'s", 'POS') hairy leg .
angela ("'s", 'POS') chair has been knocked on its side .
where ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') the fucking nitro ?
untie me , for christ ("'s", 'POS') sake , you fucking upset him and he 's dying .
angela hears sigfried ("'s", 'POS') voice from behind her back .
easy for you to say after you fuck another man ("'s", 'POS') wife .
that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a lie , sigfried .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') not that big .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') hard to stop talking about something so huge .
personally , i do n't give a fuck , ted , it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') just i do n't want to be alone right now .
sigfried heaves the gun over his shoulder , grabs a half-empty bottle of jack daniel ("'s", 'POS') , and passes it to ted , who takes a hit .
that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') beautiful .
ted is overcome by the sweetness in sigfried ("'s", 'POS') voice and follows him to the window willingly .
that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') nice of you to say , ted , but i probably should make a clean break of it , cut her loose and get my own place .
that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') love , ted , it 's like a path of light in an ocean of darkness .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') somewhere around here .
continuing hey , what ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') your name ?
he finally has one moment ("'s", 'POS') peace after an already long night .
close-up of a cigarette hanging out of a man ("'s", 'POS') mouth as he speaks into the telephone .
he watches his wife comb juancho ("'s", 'POS') hair down and to the side like an idiot .
man begins to slick juancho ("'s", 'POS') hair back .
he ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') happy he 's going to look like his dad .
man is starting to have problems of his own with juancho ("'s", 'POS') hair .
juancho ("'s", 'POS') hair is thinner than man 's , so it wo n't stay up .
he looks at his own cool hair , and then down at juancho ("'s", 'POS') , which wo n't stay up .
you 've got your mother ("'s", 'POS') hair .
in anger , man starts messing up juancho ("'s", 'POS') hair .
furious , man simply swipes juancho ("'s", 'POS') hair back down and to the side , the way wife had it before .
putting a plastic clip in sarah ("'s", 'POS') hair there .
man blows smoke in wife ("'s", 'POS') face as he walks out of the bathroom .
we can see the wheels turning in man ("'s", 'POS') head .
shrugs let ('us', 'PP (us)') just leave the kids here .
he kisses wife ("'s", 'POS') face and exits the bathroom .
ted appears at the door with man ("'s", 'POS') champagne .
three ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') good .
tell me that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') not a face you can trust .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') still there .
ted not only does n't back down , but psychologically pokes his finger in the scary man ("'s", 'POS') chest .
man ("'s", 'POS') eyes narrow .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') new year 's eve and i 'm here alone .
-- no , they 're not a pain in the ass , it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') the situation that 's a pain in the ass .
looking at name tag what ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') your name ?
if there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') an emergency , call me on the phone , like your dad said .
sarah looks over at juancho ("'s", 'POS') bare feet .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') me , sarah .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') already on .
there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') naked ladies dancing on my tv and i want ' em off .
he ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') reluctant .
sarah waits until he ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') close enough to her foot before she kicks him in the face , sending him somersaulting off the bed and crashing to the floor .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') only a matter of time before he finds mischief .
he looks at the board and see room 716 ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') light blinking .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') me .
there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') all kinds of leftover stuff around here .
there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a card in the bathroom that says you 'll bring free toothbrushes if we ask for them .
juancho puts down his champagne glass and searches his father ("'s", 'POS') coat pocket .
in the bathroom , sarah seeks out her mother ("'s", 'POS') lipstick .
sarah stands atop the chest of drawers and uses the lipstick to draw a bull{}-eye on one of the hotel art paintings .
pointing out the rules the center is the bull ("'s", 'POS') eye , 100 points , this one 's 10 points , this one 's 20 points .
she ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a little drunk .
he sees the painting on the wall but ca n't figure out what ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') different about it .
you wanna look nice in case there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') an earthquake , don'tcha ?
what ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') that ?
what happens when it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') morning ?
juancho looks at her as if she ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') drunk .
stuffed into the bedsprings is a woman ("'s", 'POS') dead and beaten corpse .
what do you want now , for christ ("'s", 'POS') sake !
there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a dead body in my bed !
that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') just your brother .
no , there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a woman 's dead body inside the bed , in the mattress .
get your ass up here and call the police , because there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a dead body in my bed and it smells like shit and it looks even worse , and if you do n't help us , my dad is gonna lay you down right next to her , i swear to fucking god !
she ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') drunk all right .
as he walks away from the counter , he spots the children ("'s", 'POS') parents driving up to the valet out front .
ted pushes the champagne out of sarah ("'s", 'POS') hand , spilling it onto the floor .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') your feet !
into the phone police , it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') an emergency !
pause hello , police , this is the mon signor hotel , get someone up here right fucking now , there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a dead whore stuffed under the mattress !
tears well in sarah ("'s", 'POS') eyes as she looks at the body .
into the phone i 'm dead fucking serious , there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a dead fucking whore stuffed in the bedsprings of the fucking bed !
ted staggers and grabs hold of the dead woman ("'s", 'POS') foot for support as he steps on the remote control , flipping the tv on to the nudie channel , just as ...
man ("'s", 'POS') pov : focused on the dead woman in the bedsprings .
we pan up the dead woman ("'s", 'POS') leg to find ted holding her foot .
pan up to the dripping champagne bottle in sarah ("'s", 'POS') hand , then over to the cigarette hanging out of juancho 's mouth .
super : one minute after robert ("'s", 'POS') story .

what ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') the problem ?
okay , let ('us', 'PP (us)') just skip over the witches .
well , for one thing it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') the difference between a .44 magnum and a magnum .357 .
yelling to the room anybody live here named ... to ted what ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') her name again ?
yeah , i 'm betty , it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') my fuckin ' place , who the fuck are you ?

that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') the chester rush party , they want something .
-- you say there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a dead body in a room ?
no problem , this is a hotel , we 've had dead bodies before , it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') just the price of doing business .
ted , he ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a very important guest of this hotel .
he ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') only minorly successful in the attempt .
at this moment in time , he ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') the king , and he has the swagger of a new king .
and the look on his face says , " king ("'s", 'POS') good . "
he is completely oblivious to the rest of the room ("'s", 'POS') activity .
in chester ("'s", 'POS') hand is an ever present glass of champagne , which he constantly spills as he gestures wildly .
closing the door his name ("'s", 'POS') theodore .

but if i win , it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') not inconceivable that leo or myself , at the last minute , might not be able to wield the ax .
and chester ("'s", 'POS') willin ' to pay for it .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') chester who now plays " beat the clock . "
he lays another hundred on the pile whether it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') you who holds the ax , he lays another hundred on the pile or the desk clerk downstairs , he lays another hundred on the pile or some bum we yank off the street .
you know , ted , a person ("'s", 'POS') life is made up of a zillion little experiences .
he lays down the last bill on the pile so , are you gonna remember for the next forty years , give or take a decade , how you refused a thousand dollars for one second ("'s", 'POS') worth of work , or how you made a thousand dollars for one second 's worth of work ?
well , ted , what ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') it gonna be ?

one of santanico ("'s", 'POS') flunkies brings the naked woman a robe , which she puts on .
so finally she comes across the big bad wolf and the big bad wolf ("'s", 'POS') laughing and says : " little red riding hood , you know better than to be walking around these woods alone .

her nose recedes into her face like a rodent ("'s", 'POS') .
santanico leaps across the floor , lands on his back and sinks her fangs into richie ("'s", 'POS') wounded shoulder .
seth turns to his brother ("'s", 'POS') cry .
he sees santanico pandemonium , like a mongoose attached to a cobra , legs wrapped around richard ("'s", 'POS') waist , fangs buried deep in his shoulder , and richard screaming and slamming about , trying to knock her off .
seth tries to aim his gun , but there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') too much movement .

fangs grow in big emilio ("'s", 'POS') mouth that make him look like a huge walking shark .
just when big emilio ("'s", 'POS') ready to strike , he hears behind him ,
once on the floor , seth and jacob , stand over the huge vamp , beating him with clubs and pipes , like l.a. ("'s", 'POS') finest .
that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') enough .
chet ("'s", 'POS') eyes roll up back into his head .
he plunges the stake into his own heart , but instead of the vampire ("'s", 'POS') cry that escapes from the others upon being staked , chet lets out a sigh of relief .
kate and scott run from behind the bar to their father ("'s", 'POS') side .
at that moment a bright flash erupts , illuminating everyone ("'s", 'POS') face .
they bang on the door , but it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') useless .
he walks over to his dead brother ("'s", 'POS') body and kneels beside it .
seth goes to kiss his brother ("'s", 'POS') lips when , richard 's eyes pop open .
richard pulls seth down to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big bite , when sex machine grabs seth from behind and yanks him from richard ("'s", 'POS') grasp .
richard sees the wood in the biker ("'s", 'POS') hand .
that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a matter of opinion , and i do n't give a fuck about your 's .
seth , still holding the outstretched gun , takes the stake out of sex machine ("'s", 'POS') hand .

richie , here ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') the peace in death i could never give you in life .
seth puts the stake over richard ("'s", 'POS') heart .
using the butt of his .45 like a hammer , he pounds the stake into richard ("'s", 'POS') heart .

everyone ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') so busy they do n't notice their new friend .
sex machine , big emilio ("'s", 'POS') baseball bat in hand , is halfway to the rescue .
as the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out of kate ("'s", 'POS') shoulder , kate rams her head back , hitting the vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs .
he releases her and spits out his teeth just as sex machine runs up and swings the baseball bat upside the vamp ("'s", 'POS') head , breaking the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor .
as the vamp lies on the floor seeing stars , sex machine grabs one of the broken ends of the bat and shoves it in the vamp ("'s", 'POS') heart .
sex machine raises his stake as cat cap dies and drives it in the vamp ("'s", 'POS') black heart .
to kate what ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') your name , girly ?
seth , who is barricading doors and window , looks in scott ("'s", 'POS') direction .
once seth hits the ground , the bat-thing which has the body of a fat rat with a bat ("'s", 'POS') large wingspan lickity-split runs up seth 's body to his juggler .
seth ("'s", 'POS') hand grabs the bat 's neck , and tries to push it away .
but the bat-thing has its claws dug in seth ("'s", 'POS') clothes .
the bat-thing is just inches from seth ("'s", 'POS') face .

mr. barrel spins in o-ren ("'s", 'POS') direction shooting her a look she 's never seen from him before .
as he walks , when he ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') parallel with the bride , he stops and says ;
before he exits the restaurant , he throws a look in sofie ("'s", 'POS') direction , who 's lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood , and says ;
the bride just smiles at her rival ("'s", 'POS') response .
o-ren ("'s", 'POS') composure returns .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') quite beautiful .
the bride unsheaths her sword quickly ... holding it out in front of her ... tip of blade pointed at o-ren ... sword ("'s", 'POS') handle and her fingers wrapped around that handle , up by her cheek ... her eyes are reflected on the blade ... snow falls around her .
o-ren ("'s", 'POS') feet white socks in wooden clogs , walk forward , crunching snow underneath them ...
o-ren leaps in the air does a somersault over the bride ("'s", 'POS') head , landing behind her opponent .
o-ren goes in for the kill ... the bride meets her blade ... the blades clash and lock ... the two women ("'s", 'POS') faces come together as the blades become entangled ...
o-ren moves her arm in a counter-clockwise motion that loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into the bride ("'s", 'POS') mouth ...
the bride ("'s", 'POS') striking o-ren - not fatally - but deep .

the farmer ("'s", 'POS') wife , charlotte , comes to the doorway of their home , followed by her two other teenage daughters , and sees the germans approaching .
removing his gray s.s. cap , the german steps inside the frenchman ("'s", 'POS') home .
col. landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the farmer ("'s", 'POS') wife and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen , smiling in his direction .
the s.s. colonel clicks his heels together and takes the hand of the french farmer ("'s", 'POS') wife .
he kisses her hand , then continues without letting go of his hostess ("'s", 'POS') hand .
farmer ("'s", 'POS') wife
while still holding the french woman ("'s", 'POS') hand and looking into her eyes , the s.s. colonel says :
the farmer offers the s.s. colonel a seat at the family ("'s", 'POS') wooden dinner table .
the nazi officer accepts the french farmer ("'s", 'POS') offer and lowers himself into the chair , placing his gray s.s. cap on the table and keeping his black attaché case on the floor by his feet .
the farmer ("'s", 'POS') wife follows her husband 's orders and gathers her daughters , taking them outside , closing the door behind them .
the two men are alone at the farmer ("'s", 'POS') dinner table , in the farmer 's humble home .
when under new management , there ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') always a slight duplication of efforts .
he also extracts an expensive black fountain pen from his uniform ("'s", 'POS') front pocket .
lying horizontally underneath the farmer ("'s", 'POS') floorboards .
these human beings are the dreyfuses , who have lived lying down underneath the dairy farmer ("'s", 'POS') house for the past year .
as he walks over and fills the nazi colonel ("'s", 'POS') glass , the german officer talks .
now the führer and goebbels ("'s", 'POS') propaganda have said pretty much the same thing .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a hostile world indeed .
the farmer ("'s", 'POS') cool facade is little by little eroding .
as the nazi colonel busies himself with his smoking , he continues to hold court at the frenchman ("'s", 'POS') table .

and that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') exactly what we 're gonna do to them .
that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') why any and every son-of-a-bitch we find wearin ' a nazi uniform , they 're gonna die .

that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a clever disguise .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') only you and
what ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') your name ?
the camera pulls back , and we see we 're not looking at a title card at all , but a calender stuck on the wall of the little cinema ("'s", 'POS') projection booth .
it would appear that shosanna passed madame mimieux ("'s", 'POS') exceptional test .
this will be " shosanna ("'s", 'POS') theme . "
the second reel change mark pops on in the same place that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') the one .

of course , but that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') not likely to happen .
it was myself and a thousand rounds of ammo in a bird ("'s", 'POS') nest , against three hundred soviet soldiers .

a bird ("'s", 'POS') nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower .

goebbels ("'s", 'POS') voice says offscreen :
he looks to francesca to translate , but she ('has', 'VHZ') just taken a big bite of tiramisu .
and normally , this is herr goebbels ("'s", 'POS') french interpreter , mademoiselle francesca mondino .
narrator ("'s", 'POS') voice comes on soundtrack :
francesca mondino is much more than goebbels ("'s", 'POS') french interpreter .
she ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') also goebbels 's favorite french actress to appear in his films .

it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') quite good .
francesca interprets goebbels ("'s", 'POS') german for shosanna .
unless the girl ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a simpleton , i 'm sure she 's figured it out by now .
to abandon previous plans for private zoller ("'s", 'POS') film premiere and change the venue to your cinema .

the s.s. officer sits down , and it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') our old friend from the first scene , col. hans landa .
francesca ("'s", 'POS') memory is jogged .
she repeats it by whispering it in goebbels ("'s", 'POS') ear .
oh , yes , of course , that ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') it .

col. landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small table in the outside patio area of maxim ("'s", 'POS') .
the fluency and poetic proficiency of the s.s. jew hunter ("'s", 'POS') french reveals to the audience that his feigning clumsiness at french with monsieur lapadite in the film 's first scene was simply an interrogation technique .
it ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') not so terrible .
she ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') about to answer when a waiter approaches .
the key to col. landa ("'s", 'POS') power and / or charm , depending on the side one 's on , lies in his ability to convince you he 's privy to your secrets .
yes , he ('is/was', 'VBZ (copula)') a frenchman .

the lobby of shosanna ("'s", 'POS') cinema , pimped out in nazi iconography .
we see workers trying with incredible difficulty to hoist the huge , heavy , and twinkingly fragile chandelier in shosanna ("'s", 'POS') auditorium , which now resembles something out of one of tinto brass 's italian b-movie ripoffs of visconti 's " the damned . "
she ('is/was', 'VBZ (auxiliary)') soundlessly escorting them to the door as they make their good-byes .
and with madame mimieux ("'s", 'POS') three hundred and fifty nitrate film print collection ,

shosanna splices her and marcel ("'s", 'POS') footage into reel 4 of fredrick 's film , rewinds it , puts it back in the can , and
hicox is dressed in a german gray s.s. captain ("'s", 'POS') uniform .
wilhelm wicki joins the shot , dressed in a german s.s. lieutenant ("'s", 'POS') uniform .
